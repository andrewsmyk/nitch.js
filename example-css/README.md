These are some basic example styles for the widgets;
* Modal - Does the background overlay
* Progress bar - styles and positions the progress bar
* Debug timing timeline - styles and positions of the timeline

All widgets are prefixed with nitch-* so it would make styling around them easier.

You don't need to include these styles in your app if you don't use the widgets or you can easily use your own in their place.
