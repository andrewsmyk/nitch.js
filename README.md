========

You've heard of [Responsive Web Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design) right? Well Nitch is designed as a responsive web game library. The idea is simple, create a game that can be played on any device you like. It offers
* Simple DOM manipulation
* Simple events, such as on, off, fire and a custom cross-device "tap" event
* A state machine to track events through your game based on [Jake Gordon's Javascript Finite State Machine](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine/)
* A progress loader system
* XHR requests
* Device and media query detection to deliver the right css and app cache manifest for your device
* An abstracted stats system that captures stats even offline (and sends them when the user comes back online)
* Better Math.Random based on the [Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)
* Some handy utilities like firing a method only once and replacing default values in an object with your own
* Oh yeah, and a simple modal
