nitch.js
========

Nitch is designed as a multi-device HTML5 games framework. It offers
* Simple DOM manipulation
* Simple events, such as on, off, fire and a custom cross-device "tap" event
* A state machine to track events through your app
* A progress loader system
* XHR requests
* Device and media query detection to deliver the right css and app cache manifest for your device
* An abstracted stats system that captures stats even offline (and sends them when the user comes back online)
* Better Math.Random based on the [Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)
* Some handy utilities like firing a method only once and replacing default values in an object with your own
* Oh yeah, and a simple modal
 
*Please note*, it's very early days so not everything is guaranteed to work correctly bug reports and pull requests welcome.
